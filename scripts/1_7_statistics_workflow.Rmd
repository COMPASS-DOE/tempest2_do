```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F,
                      message = F, 
                      warning = F)
```

### Purpose

This markdown documents the statistics workflow used for the TEMPEST2 story. The markdown is intended to specifically identify which statistics were used, in what order, and why they were needed. This is resulting from discussions with AMP/Pat/other co-authors about the need for more rigorous testing of statistical assumptions to make sure the tests we're using are valid, and the results are trustworthy.


### Workflow

This is the statistics workflow for deciding what test to use. All tests are comparing the means of different groups to each other, so the first decision point is based on testing distributions for normality.

```{r setup}

### VWC

We will run through the stats in the order that analyses appear in the paper, starting with VWC {.tabset}


#### Are data normally distributed?
